## Credits and changes

I followed a course from udemy.com
Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More! By Jonas Schmedtmann.

Changes I personally made:

1. Used a more popular folder structure and naming convention in SASS.
2. Used NPM package: sass, and not node-sass, because soon it will be deprecated.
3. Used Image CDN, for transformation, optimization, and delivery of images.
4. Used ParcelJS, for performance, optimization, bundling, etc.
5. Added meta tags, for better SEO.
6. Changed some styles, for responsiveness.
7. Added functionality with JavaScript:
   - fully working navigation.
   - closing popup, by clicking outside of the popup.
